# Tailwind CSS Styles Not Applying Bug Report

This repository demonstrates a common issue encountered when using Tailwind CSS: styles not being applied to components, despite proper configuration.

## Bug Description

The Tailwind CSS configuration appears correct, custom colors are defined in the theme, and classes are correctly used in components. However, the styles associated with these classes do not render on the page.  The primary problem appears to be in the `content` option of the `tailwind.config.js` file, specifically where the paths to locate templates are defined. This often happens when a project has a non-standard directory structure.

## Solution

The solution involves carefully reviewing the `content` array in your `tailwind.config.js` to ensure it includes all relevant files and directories where your HTML templates, including JSX or TSX files are placed. This often involves adjusting the glob patterns to encompass the actual project structure.

## How to Reproduce

1. Clone this repository.
2. Install dependencies: `npm install`
3. Run the development server (the exact command will depend on your project setup).
4. Observe that the styles are not being applied.

## Solution Details

The solution file demonstrates the corrected `content` option and other configurations required to successfully include templates.
